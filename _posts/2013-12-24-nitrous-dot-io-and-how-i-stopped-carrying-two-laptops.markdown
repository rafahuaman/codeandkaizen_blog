This post is bittersweet. 

Not too long ago I wrote about how [I breathed new life to my old college laptop](/blog/2013/10/06/my-ubuntu-laptop/) by turning it into my development/learning computer. When I was done, I was happy. I started using it all the time and even bringing with me when I traveled for work which meant carrying two laptops. I did not care though. My Ubuntu laptop was worth it! 

This lasted about two months. A few weeks ago I attended a programming workshop at Full Stack Academy. We spent a few hours working through a few exercises in JavaScript and sharing our solutions. The workshop was good and the instructors were fun; however, they showed me one thing that changed my life. They introduced me to [nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/). Nitrous.io is cloud based development environment with a web-based IDE and cloud VMs. What does this mean? You get a Linux box in your browser (Mind blown!). Maybe I am little late to the party but this literally changed my life. I do not carry two laptops when I travel for work anymore. I travel weekly so this is huge for me. 

I recently transferred all my projects to nitrous.io (this blog too!) and life has been much easier that way (Sweet!). 

My old laptop is still awesome but I don't use it that much and is back to collecting dust (Bitter!).

Anyway... cloud based IDEs are the **future**! In fact a quick google search just confirmed that you can use the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=9984) and [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) - another popular web based IDE - to get a development environment for $35. This is extremely exciting. 

That is all for now.
