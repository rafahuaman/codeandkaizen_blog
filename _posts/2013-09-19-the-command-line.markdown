This is not completely new to me. I have used the windows and UNIX command lines in the past. I used it in school to compile programs archive them. I hadn't really used for anything other than that. The point is that I wasn't a complete stranger. I debated whether I should skip this section of my road map. However, I decided against it. Since my goal is to be proficient in every aspect of web development I not could afford missing important information in one of the basics skills. Besides I had never had any "training" in terms of the command line. 

I decided to go with the <a href=” http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/”> Command Line Crash Course</a> by Learn code the hard way. 

The course was really useful. It really makes a point of making the readers memorize the commands by practicing with flash cards and doing the exercises over and over again. Doing the exercises over and over again gets repetitive but you can be sure that if you follow the instructions you will be very familiar with the command line by the end of it. 

So yes, the course will make you familiar with the command line and some of its more advanced features such as piping and redirecting; however, if you are already familiar with it. There is not that much more to learn here. I recommend it if you are completely new to it but if you are not complete beginner skip the sections you already know.
