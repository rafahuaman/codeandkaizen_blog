After some research I have narrowed down the list of technologies and topics that a junior web developer should know. To put this list together I researched the technologies that the leading web development shops are using, the curricula offered at several popular Web Dev. workshops, and different posts on the web with advice related to this subject.  I am very familiar with several of these concepts; however, I plan spend some time on all of them, I want to be thorough. 


The Stack
---------

*	Basic programming concepts
*	the Ruby programming language
*	Rails, the framework to develop web application with Ruby
*	Libraries / Ruby Gems
*	Rspec, Test Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodologies 
*	HTML and CSS, I will try HAML and Sass
*	JavaScript and jQuery
*	Database Concepts
*	Web basics - forms, HTTP request / response
*	UNIX command line and development environment
*	Deployment and Server Management
*	Git and Github, Source code version control systems
*	Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
