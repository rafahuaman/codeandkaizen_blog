  <p>After a few months of work, I have finally completed my first practice app. I built it little by little in the mornings before work and on the weekends as well.</p>

<p>With this app I wanted to demonstrate to myself what I had learned about Ruby and Rails. At the same time I was looking to build something slightly different that I had not seen before. I took this approach to keep me motivated. I didn&rsquo;t want to write just another to-do app or blogging app. developing something new kept me going.</p>

<p>Another decision I made about building this app is that I wanted to keep it simple with relatively few features. The reason for this is that I didn&rsquo;t want to get distracted by frivolous features that would have made this project go on forever. I believe I accomplshied the vision I had at the beginning.</p>

<p>I ended up building a debating forum. It looks a lot a lot like a forum except for the emphasis on a two sided discussion which is reinforced by the layout of the comments. Additionally, I included some features in order to emulate the experience of a debate. I implemented what I thought adding to an argument, correcting someone, and making counterarguments could look like on the web.</p>

<p>In the end I have a working app with most of the components built from scratch. I didn&rsquo;t want to depend on gems for this project since another one of my goals was to get more familiar with the Rails framework by building everything that I needed.</p>

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

<h4>Things that worked</h4>

<p>Working on the app a little everyday was definitely very helpful. I had a lot going on with work at the time so dividing my tasks on very small chunks every day made me feel that I was making progress all the time. I will definitely attempt to keep this approach in future projects.</p>

<p>Saving the weekends for potentially time-consuming or research oriented tasks made a big difference. The weekends provided the time I needed to fully immerse myself on some problems. I would usually save this time for the features that I knew were going to be more difficult. I would also use this time to solve any problems that I had during the week. I would focus on small victories every day knowing I had the weekend to resolve my bigger issues. If I got stuck on something, I would stop; make a note to do look at it on the weekend, and move on to the next task.</p>

<h4>Things that I should avoid next time</h4>

<p>I lost some steam towards the end. I wanted to be done and rushed a few features. The voting component comes to mind. I think that a big part of this was due to the fact I always considered this a &ldquo;practice&rdquo; app. It served its purpose and I was ready to move on.</p>

<p>I left some parts of the front-end unpolished; that made me feel that I shouldn&rsquo;t spend more time on it. If I had spent a bit more time on making my app look better, I would have probably been more excited about continuing to work on it instead of moving on. I could have made the app look better when I noticed I disliked something; however, front-end design wasn&rsquo;t one of the main goals of this project. So in the spirit of staying true to my goals, I only did what was visually &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Next time I will definitely focus a bit more on the front-end and try to always fix anything that I think is lacking.</p>

<p>So that is it. It was a pretty nice exercise. I am proud of this little app. It helped me a lot but I am already working on a different project. I am planning to spend more time polishing my next app so that I can actually release it to the world.</p>
