    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is pretty straight forward. I had setup a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account in the past. But I had rarely used it. I used the free <a href=” the http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1”>Try git tutorial</a> from <a href=” http://www.codeschool.com/”>Code School</a> to help me started. I started using git with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and with <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Rails tutorial</a>.
I have started using git to version all of the code I am writing. Additionally, I have been uploading all the code I have completed from tutorials to Github.
The interesting thing about uploading code to Github is that it forced me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactor</a> and make my code nicer. The thought that my code was out there for everyone to see, made me push myself to make it better!
I have used only few of the features Git and Github have to offer. I use it for code versioning mostly.Additionally, <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching">branching</a> is a useful feature that I have started to understand. With some discipline and practice I will introduce branching to my everyday coding. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of Git. Anyone interested in learning more should check out <a href=http://git-scm.com/book> the Pro Git book</a>.</p>
