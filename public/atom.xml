    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you like my title? I like my goals and projects to sound <strong>EPIC</strong>!</p>

<p>Several weeks ago I decided I wanted to become a full-fledged web developer. After reading about agile development, TDD, and the tools and languages that developers were using nowadays, I got very interested in the subject.
I made this decision after analyzing what I really liked doing professionally. It took me a couple of years of being in the workforce to really see what options were available to me and to learn what type of job I liked. Being a technology consultant helped with this because I was exposed to many different companies and wore several different throughout multiple projects.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>I like Building things.</li>
<li>I like programming. At work, I enjoy tasks that involved coding.</li>
<li>I like programming applications over to process automation or database management.</li>
</ul>


<p>
So it turns out, I want to be programming all day, building applications and solving problems with code.
In the next few weeks I will document my progress as I teach myself the skills necessary to be a web developer. Let the adventure begin!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am Rafael.</p>

<p>Welcome to my new blog. Here I will post about my attempts to learn new things and improve myself. I figured that writing about my learning experiences will be a good way to reflect on what I learned and at the same time document my progress.</p>

<p>A little about me:</p>

<p>I am technology consultant out of New York City. I have been working in the financial industry helping companies improve their regulatory processes through technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>I flew 100,000 miles last year.</li>
<li>I am from Lima, Peru. I lived there until I was 17.</li>
<li>I graduated from the University of Richmond with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics</li>
<li>I like books, comics, movies, and video games. </li>
<li>I have played every generation of Pokémon games.  ಠ_ಠ  </li>
<li>I like tennis but I don&#8217;t watch sports.</li>
<li>I prefer non-fiction to fiction books.</li>
</ul>


<p>And&hellip;</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">building</a>, <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">learning</a>, <a href="http://hackaday.com/">hacking</a>, <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">programming</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">optimizing my life</a>. These last five things are my reason for creating this blog, so you will most likely find posts about them.</p>

<p>That is all for now. Introduction done!</p>

<p>Please comment! I love suggestions and ideas. Please include sources or examples when available.</p>
