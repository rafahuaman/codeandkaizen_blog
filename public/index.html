      <p>OK so this one is a bit interesting. After playing around with Java, I decided I needed to have a really good grasp of the web fundamentals. So the next step would be HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I had learned a bit about HTML and CSS before, but I hadn&rsquo;t really dived deep into the subject. After a few Google searches and reading a few reviews I decided to get the book HTML and &amp; CSS Design and build websites by Jon Duckett. This book was great!. Short and concise explanations paired with excellent visual design and great photographs. The book was just so pretty it was a joy to read and to hold. The book has a companion website which you can use to get the source code and images for the examples. Besides core HTML and CSS concepts, the book covers best practices, backwards and cross-browser compatibility. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about HTML and CSS and get acquainted with some design concepts.</p>

<p>I was about all done with the HTML part of the book when I stumbled upon CodeAcademy. An enlightened internet user mentioned it on Quora and I decided to take a look out of curiosity. What a great find! You really have to give credit to the programming community for building such amazing learning resources and making them available to the public for free. CodeAcademy offers free coding courses through their interactive online platform, which allows its users to code right on the browser and see immediate results without any previous setup. CodeSchool and Treehouse offer paid versions of this web service. At around $25 a month, access to these websites is a bargain, they offer as similar platforms for learning paired with videos and a lot more courses to choose from. CodeAcademy does not have as much content as its paid counterparts but it&rsquo;s free!</p>

<p>CodeAcademy was just what I needed. Reading the books and following along some of the work was great but I needed additional exercises. CodeAcademy helped me with this. And I was quickly done with their &ldquo;Web Fundamentals&rdquo; track which included HTML and CSS. Code Academy had effectively replaced my book even though it wasn&rsquo;t as detailed. I imagine that the great people at CodeAcademy will add more advanced courses with time.</p>

<p>After finishing the HTML and CSS course I felt good about what I had learned. Let&rsquo;s be honest, I won&rsquo;t be able to memorize all the tags and syntax unless I use them repeatedly. But there are plenty of resources out there I can use to check for syntax rules when the time comes. I already use HTML while editing these blog posts, but CSS will be a bit harder to use on a regular basis.</p>

<p>At this point I wanted to move forward so I did. I was done with HTML &amp; CSS and CodeAcademy offered several tracks so I quickly moved onto Ruby.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/blog/2013/08/20/a-java-refresher/">A Java Refresher</a></h1>
      <p>The first thing I decided to do was to refresh my knowledge of Java and object oriented programming in general. This is probably not the best option for a total beginner. Most of the resources out there that teach Web Dev skills start easy with HTML &amp; CSS as well as web fundamentals. These are great for people who have just started to learn how to code. I am not a beginner though. I am well versed in a lot of technical concepts and I have already been programming for a few years. I just needed to get back in the right mindset. Exploring something familiar would help me do that quickly. So Java it was!</p>

<p>I grabbed a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208">Head first: Java</a> and started to quickly going through all the concepts. I became very familiar with Java during my college years. But I have been out of practice for a while. Saying that I was a little rusty would be generous. After some reading I started to remember the concepts faster and faster.
The book was very unique. It tries to keep you interested by not being a conventional &ldquo;boring&rdquo; book, so it throws pictures at you and keeps you &ldquo;off balance&rdquo; by not following a conventional form. In short, I liked it and if I ever need to reference some Java concepts again I would probably pick it up one more time.</p>

<p>I did not read the whole book. I did not focus on syntax but I did pay a lot of attention to the sections that involved Object Oriented Programming concepts and good practices. I also went to <a href="http://codingbat.com/">CodingBat.com</a> to practice some basic concepts like recursion and solve some puzzles. This was good enough for me and I decided I was ready to move on.
I thought about starting a bigger project like a simple Android App as a way to practice some more. This was very tempting. The idea of building an App sounded very appealing and fun. Nevertheless, I decided to remain focused and stick to roadmap and topics I laid out.</p>

<p>Next: HTML and CSS</p>

      <p>After some research I have narrowed down the list of technologies and topics that a junior web developer should know. To put this list together I researched the technologies that the leading web development shops are using, the curricula offered at several popular Web Dev. workshops, and different posts on the web with advice related to this subject.  I am very familiar with several of these concepts; however, I plan spend some time on all of them, I want to be thorough.</p>

<h2>The Stack</h2>


<ul>
<li>Basic programming concepts</li>
<li>the Ruby programming language</li>
<li>Rails, the framework to develop web application with Ruby</li>
<li>Libraries / Ruby Gems</li>
<li>Rspec, Test Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodologies </li>
<li>HTML and CSS, I will try HAML and Sass </li>
<li>JavaScript and jQuery</li>
<li>Database Concepts</li>
<li>Web basics - forms, HTTP request / response </li>
<li>UNIX command line and development environment</li>
<li>Deployment and Server Management</li>
<li>Git and Github, Source code version control systems</li>
<li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts</li>

      <p>Do you like my title? I like my goals and projects to sound <strong>EPIC</strong>!</p>

<p>Several weeks ago I decided I wanted to become a full-fledged web developer. After reading about agile development, TDD, and the tools and languages that developers were using nowadays, I got very interested in the subject.
I made this decision after analyzing what I really liked doing professionally. It took me a couple of years of being in the workforce to really see what options were available to me and to learn what type of job I liked. Being a technology consultant helped with this because I was exposed to many different companies and wore several different throughout multiple projects.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>I like Building things.</li>
<li>I like programming. At work, I enjoy tasks that involved coding.</li>
<li>I like programming applications over to process automation or database management.</li>
</ul>


<p>
So it turns out, I want to be programming all day, building applications and solving problems with code.
In the next few weeks I will document my progress as I teach myself the skills necessary to be a web developer. Let the adventure begin!</p>

      <p>I am Rafael.</p>

<p>Welcome to my new blog. Here I will post about my attempts to learn new things and improve myself. I figured that writing about my learning experiences will be a good way to reflect on what I learned and at the same time document my progress.</p>

<p>A little about me:</p>

<p>I am technology consultant out of New York City. I have been working in the financial industry helping companies improve their regulatory processes through technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>I flew 100,000 miles last year.</li>
<li>I am from Lima, Peru. I lived there until I was 17.</li>
<li>I graduated from the University of Richmond with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics</li>
<li>I like books, comics, movies, and video games. </li>
<li>I have played every generation of Pokémon games.  ಠ_ಠ  </li>
<li>I like tennis but I don&#8217;t watch sports.</li>
<li>I prefer non-fiction to fiction books.</li>
</ul>


<p>And&hellip;</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">building</a>, <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">learning</a>, <a href="http://hackaday.com/">hacking</a>, <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">programming</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">optimizing my life</a>. These last five things are my reason for creating this blog, so you will most likely find posts about them.</p>

<p>That is all for now. Introduction done!</p>

<p>Please comment! I love suggestions and ideas. Please include sources or examples when available.</p>
