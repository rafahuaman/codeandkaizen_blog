This is a post about my [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org/) experience a few months ago. For those who don't know what a Code Retreat is please visit [coderetreat.org](http://coderetreat.org/). 

This is not going be extensive. I don't want to go into the details and the specific exercises because that would be like spoilers. I am just going to focus on the new things I learned/tried that day and my overall conclusion. 


## Pair Programming
To those that have never tried it, a code retreat is a great way to pair program for the first time. The first time I paired was during a job interview. When I told some people this, I got some raised eyebrows and some "Yikes! I bet that was intimidating". It didn't think so at the time but afterwards while analyzing my performance I concluded that my interactions were little awkward. I could have used some practice... well this retreat was just what I needed. In a single day I paired over and over again. I paired with both industry veterans and beginners and I learned a lot with each one. The best part is that everyone was always friendly and fun willing to teach and be open to criticism. 

I even found myself in a situation where my partner was flying through code and he got stuck and couldn't find the problem. He didn't quite stop though and was flying through tests and switching screens between the Ruby documentation and our program. I had to found a way to put the brakes on his speed and slowly take a few steps back to where I thought the bug was. I was abrupt but polite, all the time hoping he wouldn't take it the wrong way. In the end he thanked me for it! It those little learning moments that make code retreats a valuable experience

## Retrospectives
Actually looking back at what we did at every step of the way. This was neat; it really drove the point of Agile and refactoring home. We shouldn't just refactor code but also try to improve ourselves and our practices. 

## VIM
Most people at the retreat were fine with using Sublime and this was working fine until one of pairs said "Have you ever used VIM? You will learn today." How can you say no to a free VIM lightning class? It was definitely a challenge at first but I got the basics down easy enough. I can see how with practice and a few neat features productivity can increase dramatically. I have not converted completely but ever since the retreat I have been practicing with vimtutor whenever I have a few free minutes. I will switch completely once I feel I am not super slow (especially now that I am using nitrous.io -- more to come on this).

## Flexing coding muscles
Those exercises really make you think. The exercises are designed to teach and they are good at that. Every exercise makes you think hard and a lot and in different ways too. Simple constraints like telling you not to use a particular statement can really help you explore the limits of a programming paradigm or the features of a particular programming language. By end of the day you will be tired and you will feel great!

## Programming Styles
This comes with pairing. I had seen other people's code before at school, but they all had a style similar to mine. I guess this is expected since my classmates and I learned together.  But pairing with people who think differently is just eye-opening. Seeing different styles helped me learn new things about the Ruby programming language and showed me different ways to address problems. I had several "wow" moments when my partners suggested quick and simple solutions that I had not thought about before.

## Fun
It was all fun. What can I say? I love coding and a full day of challenges with great people was excellent. 

# Conclusion
I recommend it to everybody. Programmers need practice too and retreats are an excellent way to do it and discover many things in the process.
