I am Rafael.

Welcome to my new blog. Here I will post about my attempts to learn new things and improve myself. I figured that writing about my learning experiences will be a good way to reflect on what I learned and at the same time document my progress. 

A little about me:

I am technology consultant out of New York City. I have been working in the financial industry helping companies improve their regulatory processes through technology. 
<ul>
<li>I flew 100,000 miles last year.</li>
<li>I am from Lima, Peru. I lived there until I was 17.</li>
<li>I graduated from the University of Richmond with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics</li>
<li>I like books, comics, movies, and video games. </li>
<li>I have played every generation of Pokémon games.  ಠ_ಠ  </li>
<li>I like tennis but I don't watch sports.</li>
<li>I prefer non-fiction to fiction books.</li>
</ul>
And...

I love <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">building</a>, <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">learning</a>, <a href="http://hackaday.com/">hacking</a>, <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">programming</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">optimizing my life</a>. These last five things are my reason for creating this blog, so you will most likely find posts about them.

That is all for now. Introduction done!

Please comment! I love suggestions and ideas. Please include sources or examples when available.
