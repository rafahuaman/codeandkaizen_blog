Over the past couple of few months I have been trying to document my achievements as I went along. I found that reflecting on the things I learned as I write about them really helped me internalize some concepts. However, at some point I reached a point where I was learning and trying new things faster than I could write about them. 
Initially my solution to this was to write quick notes on what I had learned and write the complete blog post later.  This worked for a while but I quickly started falling behind on my blog entries and started accumulating lots of notes on the topics and technologies I had covered. 
One thing to keep in mind when you start learning something new is that "Diminishing Returns" really apply to this situation. I learned the basics of a lot of technologies very quickly and did not write blog entries on it. However, I have reached a point now in which I am spending quite a bit of time going through the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial</a>  and reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1379647910&sr=1-1"> Well Grounded Rubyist book</a>. My learning has slowed down. That's not a bad thing. It just means I have covered a lot of topics and is taking me a while to get more in-depth knowledge on some of the advanced concepts. I am going to take advantage of this time and catch quickly catch up my blog with all the technologies I have learned over the past couple of months. 
The next few posts will be uploaded on the same day probably. That's because I wrote them all in a day but learning and experimenting occurred over several weeks.
